# Inner Rebuild Library - Brand Guidelines

## 🎨 Ebook Cover Consistency

### Current Issues
Your existing covers have great individual elements but lack cohesive branding:
- **Inconsistent font styles** across titles
- **Color palette jumps** (blue, peach, beige, white, red)
- **Mixed layout approaches** creating "different series" feel

### Recommended Fix: Unified Series Approach

#### Template System
**Pick ONE master template** and apply consistently:

```
[SERIES BADGE] ← Small top identifier
MAIN TITLE ← Same font, size, positioning
Subtitle ← Consistent style & placement
[AUTHOR/BRAND] ← Bottom signature
```

#### Color Palette Strategy
**Controlled palette by series:**

**Self-Worth Series** (Cool palette)
- Primary: Sky blue (#0ea5e9)
- Secondary: Teal (#14b8a6) 
- Accent: Clean white (#ffffff)
- Books: "Loving Yourself First", "Healing From Within"

**Relationships Series** (Warm palette)  
- Primary: Peach (#fdba74)
- Secondary: Sunset orange (#fb923c)
- Accent: Soft gold (#fbbf24)
- Books: "Boundaries in Love", future relationship titles

#### Typography Rules
**Consistent across ALL covers:**
- **Title font**: Bold, sans-serif (same family)
- **Title size**: Consistent relative to cover
- **Subtitle**: Same weight, positioning
- **Spacing**: Identical margins and line heights

#### Brand Signature
**Add to every cover (bottom corner):**
- "Inner Rebuild Library" text mark OR
- Small logo/icon for instant brand recognition

### Quick Implementation
1. **Choose your cleanest cover** as the template (recommend "Loving Yourself First" style)
2. **Recreate all covers** using that exact layout
3. **Apply series color rules** consistently
4. **Add brand signature** to each

### Quality Checklist
✅ Same title font across all covers  
✅ Consistent subtitle styling  
✅ Series-appropriate color palette  
✅ Brand signature present  
✅ Professional, cohesive set appearance
